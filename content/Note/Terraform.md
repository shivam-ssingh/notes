Terraform is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool developed by HashiCorp that allows users to define, provision, and manage infrastructure through code. This approach enhances efficiency and reduces the potential for human error in managing cloud and on-premises resources. Terraform uses providers, which allows it to help create a configuration which is cloud agnostic. These providers are of aws, azure etc.
